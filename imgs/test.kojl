* You can write titles.
# With different symbols.
$ You can also put headers:
	# This is a header.
	+ This is a header with subheaders:
		% This is a subheader.
		% So is this. 
		% Subheaders can have sections:
			* This is a section.
			* This is also a section.

		% There are few text options:
			* <This is a bold text>
			* :This is an underlined text:

	+ You can continue your headers, titles, subheaders, and sections whenever you would like to.
	+ You can use <bold texts> and :underlined text: wherever you would like to.

$ Thanks!
